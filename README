These are benchmarks to test Titian (not spark by itself, not PerfDebug)

To add dependencies:
1. Create lib folder
2. Copy (or just link) jars from titian assembly folder.
2.a: For this development, used the titian 2.1 branch
2.b: Also be sure to include the lineage jar if using titian 2.1 jar, as the classes are not in core automatically.
2.b.i: You'll want to have built the assembly folder and lineage folder beforehand obviously. `build/mvn package -DskipTests` (and go get a coffee)
3. I just feel like this list needs at least three items, and the above is a mess.

Dev note:
	If trying to build for deployment... tough luck. idk what to do.
	Update 2/7/19: It's been a while since I worked on this aspect of the build, but I think
		that build.sbt has been configured to automatically filter out the external dependencies
		from the Titian build. In other words, building this project should effectively give you
		only the benchmark programs (which can be submitted with spark submit).
		See Jason's cluster scripts repo (xulab-scripts?) for details on submission.
