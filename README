These benchmarks are for PerfDebug specifically (not titian, not spark)

To add dependencies:
1. Create lib folder
2. Copy (or just link) jars from perfdebug assembly folder (may need to build beforehand with `build/mvn package -DskipTest`)
3. Make sure ignite is available and $IGNITE_HOME is defined.


For ease of use: check scripts under scripts/ directory.
