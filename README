OUTDATED - this was from a different repo.
To add dependencies:
1. Create lib folder
2. Copy (or just link) jars from perfdebug assembly folder (may need to build beforehand with `build/mvn package -DskipTest`)
3. Make sure ignite is available and $IGNITE_HOME is defined.
4. Use scripts under scripts/ directory.
